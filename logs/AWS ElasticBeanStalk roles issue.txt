AWS elasticBeanstalk IAM roles issue

First, let's verify if the role actually exists:

Open the IAM console
Go to the "Roles" section
Search for "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role"
If the role doesn't exist, you'll need to create it:

In the IAM console, click "Create role"
Choose "AWS service" as the trusted entity type
Select "EC2" as the use case
Attach the following policies:
AWSElasticBeanstalkWebTier
AWSElasticBeanstalkWorkerTier
AWSElasticBeanstalkMulticontainerDocker
Name the role "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role"
If the role exists but isn't showing up in Elastic Beanstalk:

Ensure the role has the correct trust relationship. Edit the trust relationship and make sure it includes:

{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Principal": {
        "Service": "ec2.amazonaws.com"
      },
      "Action": "sts:AssumeRole"
    }
  ]
}
After creating or updating the role, return to your Elastic Beanstalk environment:

Go to the "Configuration" section
Under "Security", click "Edit"
In the "Service access" settings, select the "aws-elasticbeanstalk-ec2-role" for the IAM instance profile
Apply the changes and wait for your environment to update
